# walton

walton is a little utility that gives you a nice way of finding
examples of how to use functions in clojure.  Additionally, it may
help you traverse a dangerous dungeon full of snakes.

## Usage

### From the Web

The easiest way to use Walton is through its web interface at [getclojure.org](http://getclojure.org).

### From the REPL

    user> (use 'walton.core)
 
    user> (init-walton)
    => true

    user> (walton "concat")
    
    (concat [:a :b :c])
    => (:a :b :c)
    
    user> (concat ...)

### Browse docs

Point your browser at localhost:8080/examples/zipmap to see examples
for zipmap.  Click on an example and it will expand to show you the
result of that function.

## Building

Use leiningen in the project root directory to build a jar.

    $ lein deps
    $ lein uberjar

Move the resulting walton.jar onto your classpath if you'd like to `(use 'walton.core)` in your project.  Or add it to your `ns` macro: 

    (ns myproject.core
      (:use walton.core))
